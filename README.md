# JS30# 15: localStorage-and-event-delegation-js
This is the fifteenth project of JS30 challenges by Wes Bos and shows how to use localStorage and event delegation in vanilla JavaScript projects.

### General Info
* In this project, there are a form with an input area, a button to add items and an unordered list where the items are rendered.
* When an item is added to the form, it will be put into localStorage and will be persistent even after the page is refreshed.
* When an item gets checked, it will be updated and persistent on each page refresh using event delegation and localStorage.
